                I was lucky enough to get this Semester
                Abroad program (SAP) opportunity by Sastra University and the Department of
                Bioinformatics to do my final semester project as a research internship at
                Universidad Tecnológica de Panama. My area of interest was machine learning,
                and that's the reason for choosing UTP; it has a variety of research
                opportunities across all the engineering fields. My project title is "Smart
                City (Smart local Grid and identification of anomalies with Data Analytics),
                Traceability of perishables with RFID, and Knowledge Transfer in DDDM" and
                thanks to my guide, Dr. Juan Marcos Castillo, PhD research and development
                associate at UTP, for accepting me to work on his smart city project. I was
                provided with all the facilities and materials that I needed for my
                research. For the first few weeks, I was given exploratory research papers
                and articles to peruse. And afterward, leisurely, my work advanced towards
                synchronising the traffic lights in smart cities with the help of IoT and
                machine learning tools.

                Things started to turn better for everyone
                when the 3rd wave of covid started to subside and on a personal front for me
                too as I was humbled with the opportunity to do a Student Abroad Program
                (SAP) at the Technological University of Panama (UTP). However, UTP had a
                wide range of projects to offer and I chose Smart City (Smart local Grid and
                identification of anomalies with Data Analytics), Traceability of
                perishables with RFID, and Knowledge Transfer in DDDM. This was an area that
                explored the workings of machine learning and data analytics in a platform
                that was unknown to me ‘Smart City’ and this is the same reason that excited
                me too as I was gearing up to learn something new with this as my final
                semester project under the guidance of Dr. Juan Marcos Castillo, who is a
                Ph.D. research associate at UTP. This was a fun and exciting experience as
                Dr. Juan understood that we weren’t from the same area of excellence and he
                ensured that we find a common ground where both of us could benefit from
                this project mutually. I had the opportunity to also connect with other
                students in Panama who were proficient in the same field and who could guide
                me to finish my project successfully. This opportunity gave me an exposure
                to the international labs and projects on going in Panama and their workflow
                and processes were explicit which can be imbibed and modified to our current
                Indian trends, thereby making it a wholesome learning experience. I would
                definitely suggest you all to pursue an SAP if you get a chance to!

                involved
                analyzing waste from prominent industrial sectors, studying microbes, pathways, and various factors in
                the
                microbial degradation of industrial waste. With a focus on integrating different disciplines of

                this
                internship enhanced my skills and provided extensive exposure to industrial research.

                My internship provided a comprehensive learning experience in sarcoma (cancer). I explored
                Next-Generation
                Sequencing (NGS) and its applications, focusing on "Finding the link between sarcomas and human genes
                and
                validating it using bioinformatics tools." It was a challenging task to connect human genes with
                sarcomas,
                involving research on the causes and writing a blog. I also worked on 3D printing implants for
                orthopedic
                surgery, gaining insights into the work of architects and doctors researching sarcomas and implant
